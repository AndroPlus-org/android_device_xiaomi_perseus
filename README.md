## Features

Works:

- No idea, I have yet to receive the Mix 3 so I don't have any testing devices

Not working:

- Crypto stuff like disk decryption most likely, compiling gives me a missing dependency issue. Will resolve later (Or send your pull request!)
- Again no idea, for all I know it doesn't even start because I don't have a testing device
